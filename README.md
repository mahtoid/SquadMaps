## About SquadMaps
SquadMaps is a website to display all the maps and layers in Squad. It includes an object with: Layers, Layer's Info (Weather, RAAS-type, Commander, # Flags), Side's Info (Name of the team, amount of tickets), Vehicles Info (name, amount, ticket cost, delays and cooldowns).

<br>

## Using SquadMaps
You can use the object inside the modal.js, for example to make your own visual map statistics like: 
<div align="center">
<a href="https://www.anatoliacommunity.com/index.php?dilSecimi=EN" target="_blank"><img src="img/other/example_1.jpg" alt="Logo" width="500"/></a>
</div>
